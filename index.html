<!-- This is the skills section. Where we were supposed to put in 2 skills and pictures to go with them, I did 1 set of skills and the next section displays three photos. It doesn't all look that great because the photos are real while everything else in the website is graphic design, but for the sake of learning I thought it would be cool to see what I could do with positioning and different kinds of elements. -->

<!-- This is where I'm having the hardest problem. I tried creating the button from the cssbuttoncreator that was linked to in the course, but when I updated the stylesheet with the CSS code that was generated from the button generator, nothing changed on the website. I am stuck with the regular, blue underlined anchor element hyperlink. Can't seem to figure out what is wrong. -->

<!-- Update: I was able to figure out what happened with the button. It turned out that it wasn't working for other people in the course and the reason may be that the code from the CSS Button Generator probably had some errors. I worked this out by going to Angela's completed website and inspecting, copying the CSS from there directly, and injecting it into my stylesheet. Then I changed the colors. That worked to make the button to appear as it should, but now it was having the issue of sitting on top of my paragraph text, even though the position was still static and there should have been some separation as it is in the normal flow. When I tried to apply margins to it, nothing happened, so I resorted to setting the position of the button to relative and moving it that way. -->
